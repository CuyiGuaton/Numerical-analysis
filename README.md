# Numerical-analysis
Numerical analysis algorithms created with python

There are the methods in the repository.

  - Aitken's method
  - Euler's method
  - Bézier curve with plot
  - Lagrange polynomial
  - Newton-Raphson
  - Newton polynomial
  - Runge–Kutta fourth-order method
  - Secant method
  - Simpson's rule
  - Steffensen's method
  - Trapezoidal rule

These algorithms was made for the subject numerical analysis of Computer Science.


## how run script.

Change the f(x) return in the algorithms and the initial value, they are expressed by one z letter or a x0, x1, ... , etc.

##About output

Some algorithms output is in latex format, This is because they was made for a report, feel to free to change the output if you want to.

##Other
Bezeir curve and Rouge kutta are based in other repositories, thanks you guys.
